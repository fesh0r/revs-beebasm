# Source code for Revs on the BBC Micro

This repository contains source code for Revs on the BBC Micro. The project to add commentary is ongoing. See the [accompanying website](https://revs.bbcelite.com) for more details about this project.

## Acknowledgements

Revs was written by Geoffrey J Crammond and is copyright &copy; Acornsoft 1985.

The code on this site has been disassembled from the version released on the [Complete BBC Micro Games Archive at bbcmicro.co.uk](http://bbcmicro.co.uk/game.php?id=267).

The commentary is copyright &copy; Mark Moxon. Any misunderstandings or mistakes in the documentation are entirely my fault.

### A note on licences, copyright etc.

This repository is _not_ provided with a licence, and there is intentionally no `LICENSE` file provided.

According to [GitHub's licensing documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/licensing-a-repository), this means that "the default copyright laws apply, meaning that you retain all rights to your source code and no one may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from your work".

The reason for this is that my commentary is intertwined with the original Revs game code, and the original game is copyright. The whole site is therefore covered by default copyright law, to ensure that this copyright is respected.

Under GitHub's rules, you have the right to read and fork this repository... but that's it. No other use is permitted, I'm afraid.

My hope is that the educational and non-profit intentions of this repository will enable it to stay hosted and available, but the original copyright holders do have the right to ask for it to be taken down, in which case I will comply without hesitation.  I do hope, though, that along with the various other disassemblies and commentaries of Acornsoft's games for the BBC Micro, it will remain viable.
